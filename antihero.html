      This is the page where I keep my truth. My inspirations, my heroes, my guides.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are worlds and gardens in my mind that I inhabit because of the favorite things I put into them.<br>
        I love technology and the future, especially the work of OpenAI and its creators.
        So I decided to create this blog to write and publish everything that comes to my mind. 
        I want to give you some of that magic, so I decided to help you add it to your work, whether it's a design, a presentation, or something else.<br> 
        Sam Altman, Mira Murati, Taylor Swift, Elon Musk, Ed Sheeran, and many more who have inspired me on my journey. Join me.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Without them, without OpenAI, without my secret gardens, this world would not be alive here.

    This is the heart of my land — the truth behind the gardens.  
    The name <strong>Rimon Eleven</strong> is inspired by the football club of Endou Mamoru 
    from <em>Inazuma Eleven</em> (© Level-5), my very first anime friend.

    My wand is OpenAI — built by the hard work of Sam Altman, Mira Murati, and 
    the whole team who dared to dream about machines that can learn and help.  
    But the spells, words, and designs here are my own creation.
