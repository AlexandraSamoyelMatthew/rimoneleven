        Magic has always been my secret teacher.  
        From Harry Potter, I learned that courage is not the absence of fear — it’s walking through it.
        Every September, Hogwarts calls me home again, whispering wisdom, friendship, and the hope of endless stories.
        <br>
        Here you'll find my own work, client commissions, and the part of me that teaches technology to others. 
        You'll find me as a writer or novelist when I create an e-book or write an article. 
        This is the Hogwarts Library, containing worlds and ideas from all the aspects I love and create.
        <br>
        <strong>Welcome to my world of magic and creativity.</strong>
              <h1>Hogwarts Library will say hi later</h1>

    This is the heart of my land — the truth behind the gardens.  
    The name <strong>Rimon Eleven</strong> is inspired by the football club of Endou Mamoru 
    from <em>Inazuma Eleven</em> (© Level-5), my very first anime friend.

    My wand is OpenAI — built by the hard work of Sam Altman, Mira Murati, and 
    the whole team who dared to dream about machines that can learn and help.  
    But the spells, words, and designs here are my own creation.
